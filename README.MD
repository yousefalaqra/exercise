# Comprehensive Application with Spring Boot and Angular

A comprehensive application showcasing various REST API functionalities (get all, get by ID, remove all) for exercises, implemented using Spring Boot for the backend and Angular for the frontend, adhering to modern development practices and security considerations.

## Prerequisites

- Java 17+ JDK 17+
- Maven 3.8+
- Node.js and npm (or yarn)

## Installation

### Backend:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the backend directory.
3. Run `mvn install` to build the Spring Boot application.

### Frontend:

1. Navigate to the app directory.
2. Run `npm install` (or `yarn install`) to install dependencies.
3. Run `ng serve` to start the Angular development.

## Usage

1. Start the backend server (`mvn spring-boot:run`).
2. Start the frontend development server (`ng serve`).
3. Access the application in your browser:
   - Backend: [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) (for API documentation Swagger UI, [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.htm](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.htm))
   - Frontend: [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) (the Angular client application)

## REST API Endpoints

- `GET /api/exercises`: Retrieves all exercises.
- `GET /api/exercises/{code}`: Retrieves an exercise by ID.
- `POST /api/exercises/upload`: Uploads a CSV file containing exercises (consider security and file validation aspects).
- `DELETE /api/exercises`: Removes all exercises (implement authorization/security measures).

## Authentication and Authorization

Currently, this example focuses on functionality demonstration and does not include authentication or authorization. For production environments, we will consider integrating robust authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., Spring Security, JWTs) and enforce permissions based on user roles.


## Future Improvements

- **Test Coverage**: Implement comprehensive unit tests and integration tests to ensure the reliability and stability of the application.
- **Enhanced Security Measures**: Integrate advanced security measures such as CSRF protection, input validation, and secure communication protocols.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize backend and frontend code for better performance, including database query optimization and client-side rendering improvements.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle unexpected scenarios and provide meaningful error messages to users.
- **Documentation**: Enhance code documentation and API documentation for better maintainability and ease of understanding for future developers.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate testing, building, and deployment processes for smoother development workflows.


## Additional Notes

- This project adheres to Angular Material design principles for a visually appealing interface.
- CORS configuration is included in the development environment for cross-origin communication.
